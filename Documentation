I will be dividing this project into 3 parts 

1>Mechanical design 
Frame:acrylic because of its Lightweight and High strength
Motors:Should have moderate torque to maintain stability
Wheels:Should be of moderate radius

2>Electronics
Microcontroller:ESP32 as it has wifi module in it.Though that we can have an IOT network
Battery:Li ion battery 
Motor with encoder:we will have to apply PID algorithm so we must need feedback through encoders
Sensor:IMU which has gyroscope and accelerometer to maintain balance ;
        Gps to get coordinates and do mapping 

3>Programming 
we will be needing jetson nano,or orion to do processing.
Because we have to do path planning and mapping.
